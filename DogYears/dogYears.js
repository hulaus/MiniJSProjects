// Made variable a const because my age will not be changing for another 2 or 3 months. This will be staying constant while I am making this project

const myAge = 30;

var earlyYears = 2;
//I put this variable as let because it will be changing soon

earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;

laterYears = myAge - 2;

// I wrote task 5 this way because it seems like this is how I would reassign the laterYears variable to account for mulitplying the variable by 4
laterYears = laterYears * 4;

console.log(laterYears);
console.log(earlyYears);

//I made myAgeInDogYears as a const because the formula will not be chaning it will always be ealryYears + laterYears
